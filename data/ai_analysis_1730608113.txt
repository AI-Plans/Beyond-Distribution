Analysis: { "current_interpretation": "Flat, solid surface with a shallow incline ahead", "confidence": 0.9, "reasoning": "The majority of the nearby surface normals are aligned, indicating a flat surface. The distance values also suggest that there are no large drops or cavities nearby.", "next_steps": "Move forward to explore the shallow incline and look for any changes in surface normals or distance values that may indicate a cave entrance." }
